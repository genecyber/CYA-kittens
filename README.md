```
Once upon a time a funny story was written for Starwest and YOU were put in charge. 

Will you survive or will you die of dysentery?
```

```
The basics ...
- after 1 rainbow of effort
- developers are testing better
- code is more maintainable
- testers are engaged in implementation details
- may spend too much time on less valuable unit tests
- may spend time writing code just to support the unit tests
- may lose sight of higher level tests or system level testing
- still have crap UI tests

Code that should go in here:
- higher number of unit tests, versus acceptance tests, more like pyramid than ice cream cone

Choices:
- unit tests seem good, time to focus on switching acceptance test framework
- keep going down unit tests path
  - aim at 100% coverage
  - is this a good target?
```

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "Switching Acceptance Test Framework": [turn to page 74](../page-74/README.md)
