The basics ...
- Now we have a lot more unit tests
- still have the same crappy acceptance tests
- value is diminishing

- more unit tests
- With every second of gameplay that passes, one point should be added to the score
- On initial restart of the game, the score should be saved as the high score upon start of the next game
```
