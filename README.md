You doubled down and wrote more unit tests...
```
```
The basics ...
- now there are some number more unit tests
- 1 of these should be failing in this branch; those are showing value
- ability to show value to the owners is lacking, after 2 rainbows of effort

What unit test cases should exist in here?
Additional unit tests to add could be:
- With every second of gameplay that passes one point should be added to the score
- On initial restart of the game, the score should be saved as the high score upon start of the next game
```

You have died of dysentery.
