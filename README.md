Once upon a time a funny story was written for Starwest and YOU were put in charge. 

Will you survive or will you die of dysentery?
```


```
The basics:  
- This codebase begins with an existing app and existing set of tests
- Tests should represent the ice cream cone model
  - Highest number of acceptance tests
    - At first, these should be unmaintainable Selenium crap
  - Some number of API tests
  - very few unit tests
- "legacy" application, with effort put toward testing, but somewhat misguided

- new test lead comes in and should choose where to focus attention first
- for the first 1 rainbow worth of effort, which direction do you choose?
```

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "API/Unit Tests": [turn to page 23](../page-23/README.md)

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "Switching Acceptance Test Framework": [turn to page 42](../page-42/README.md)
